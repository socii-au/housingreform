Introduction\\n\\n**One‑paragraph summary.** This model is a scenario explorer that simulates how housing policies might affect prices, rents, supply, and affordability across Australian regions. It translates policy levers into changes in demand, supply, and market dynamics, then projects outcomes over time for cities, states, and the nation. It is designed for clarity and transparency, not for predicting exact prices.\\n\\n**What it does.** It shows relative trajectories and trade‑offs under different policy combinations, with consistent inputs and assumptions that are visible in the code.\\n\\n**What it does not do.** It does not forecast exact market prices, does not simulate individual households, and does not claim causal proof. It does not replace expert assessment, local planning constraints, or regulatory impact analysis.\\n\\n**Who it is for.** Policymakers, journalists, community advocates, and analysts who need a clear, rigorous, and explainable framework to compare policy scenarios.\\n\\n**Why clarity and accuracy matter.** Housing reform debates are complex and politically sensitive. This documentation is written to make every assumption explicit, every calculation explainable, and every limitation visible.\\n\\n**How to use this documentation.** Start with the Glossary, then read the Model Architecture for the big picture, and use the Math & Stats section for step‑by‑step formulas. Each section links back to glossary terms for consistency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Glossary\\nThe glossary uses a single table with clear row separators and high‑contrast color bands.\\n\\n| Term | Plain English | Formal Definition | Why It Matters

Start with baseline values for each city.\\n2. Apply policy levers to adjust demand, supply, and investor behavior.\\n3. Simulate yearly changes in population, housing stock, prices, and rents.\\n4. Aggregate city results into state and national views.\\n5. Display outputs in charts, tables, and the heatmap.\\n\\n**Modules and responsibilities.**\\n- **Inputs layer:** baseline data, policy levers, and history.\\n- **Core simulation:** supply, demand, construction response, and price/rent changes.\\n- **Distribution layer:** decile proxy or microdata‑based stress metrics (if available).\\n- **Aggregation layer:** city → state → national outputs.\\n- **Presentation layer:** charts, map, and summary cards.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Math & Stats\\n\\n### 4.1 Price and Rent Growth\\n- **What it is:** A growth‑rate model linking supply‑demand gaps to price and rent changes.\\n- **Where it’s used:** Core simulation each year.\\n- **How it works (step‑by‑step):**\\n  1. Compute supply gap = (demand − effective supply) ÷ supply.\\n  2. Map gap to price growth via a curve (elasticity).\\n  3. Map gap to rent growth via a separate curve.\\n  4. Apply dampening or caps (e.g., rent regulation).\\n- **Worked example:**\\n  - Demand = 102,000 dwellings\\n  - Effective supply = 100,000 dwellings\\n  - Gap = (102,000 − 100,000) / 100,000 = 0.02 (2%)\\n  - If elasticity = 1.5, price growth ≈ 3% (2% × 1.5)\\n- **Assumptions:** Elasticities remain stable over the simulation.\\n\\n### 4.2 Construction Response\\n- **What it is:** New construction responds to price signals and planning capacity.\\n- **Where it’s used:** Supply evolution per year.\\n- **How it works:**\\n  1. Compute desired build rate based on price growth.\\n  2. Apply construction capacity cap.\\n  3. Apply planning/infrastructure lag and ramp‑up.\\n- **Worked example:**\\n  - Desired growth = 4%\\n  - Capacity cap = 2%\\n  - Actual growth = 2%\\n- **Assumptions:** Capacity limits are binding and realistic.\\n\\n### 4.3 Investor Demand Adjustment\\n- **What it is:** Investor demand is reduced by taxes, credit policy, and ownership caps.\\n- **Where it’s used:** Demand split between investor and owner‑occupier.\\n- **How it works:**\\n  1. Compute baseline investor share.\\n  2. Apply reductions from negative gearing removal, CGT changes, credit tightening.\\n  3. Apply ownership cap divestment flow if enabled.\\n- **Worked example:**\\n  - Baseline investor share: 35%\\n  - Policy reduction: −10%\\n  - New investor share: 31.5%\\n- **Assumptions:** Policy effects are additive within bounds.\\n\\n### 4.4 Affordability Metrics\\n- **What it is:** Price‑to‑income and rent‑to‑income ratios.\\n- **Where it’s used:** Summaries, crisis score, and narrative.\\n- **How it works:**\\n  - Price‑to‑income = median price ÷ median wage\\n  - Rent‑to‑income = median annual rent ÷ median wage\\n- **Assumptions:** Median wage is representative of household income.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Policy Mechanisms\\n\\nEach policy is modeled as a **mechanism** that affects either demand, supply, or rental stock. The section below explains each policy in plain language and how it maps into the model.\\n\\n### Negative gearing changes\\n**Definition:** Tax treatment of rental losses.  \\n**Rationale:** Reduces investor tax advantage or reverses a prior change.  \\n**Mechanism:** Lowers investor demand proportionally to policy intensity.  \\n**Evidence (summary):** Empirical estimates vary; model uses a conservative demand‑reduction range.  \\n**Common misunderstanding:** Removing negative gearing does not automatically cut prices by a fixed %.\\n\\n### Ownership cap\\n**Definition:** Limit to 1 principal + 1 investment property per individual.  \\n**Rationale:** Reduces concentration of housing ownership.  \\n**Mechanism:** Applies a divestment flow from excess investor stock, increasing listings.  \\n**Evidence (summary):** Few direct precedents; modeled as a bounded, phased adjustment.  \\n**Misunderstanding:** It does not instantly create free stock; divestment is phased.\\n\\n### Planning and rezoning (upzoning)\\n**Definition:** Increase allowable density and remove planning friction.  \\n**Rationale:** Enables more supply in high‑demand areas.  \\n**Mechanism:** Raises construction capacity and reduces effective lag.  \\n**Evidence (summary):** Zoning changes are associated with higher approvals but vary by city.\\n\\n### Public and community housing expansion\\n**Definition:** Direct government build or acquisition.  \\n**Rationale:** Increases non‑market housing and reduces rental stress.  \\n**Mechanism:** Adds to dwelling stock and reduces market demand pressure.  \\n**Evidence (summary):** Well‑documented supply effect, with timing lag.\\n\\n### Credit tightening\\n**Definition:** Serviceability buffers, DTI caps, investor lending limits.  \\n**Rationale:** Reduce leverage and speculative demand.  \\n**Mechanism:** Reduces investor and high‑risk borrower demand.  \\n**Evidence (summary):** Macroprudential policies reduce credit growth.\\n\\n### Rent regulation / caps\\n**Definition:** Limits on rent increases.  \\n**Rationale:** Protects renters from rapid increases.  \\n**Mechanism:** Caps rent growth while allowing vacancy decontrol if enabled.  \\n**Evidence (summary):** Effects depend on coverage and enforcement.\\n\\n### Vacancy tax & short‑stay regulation\\n**Definition:** Taxes or restrictions on empty or short‑stay dwellings.  \\n**Rationale:** Return homes to long‑term rental supply.  \\n**Mechanism:** Increases rental stock and lowers rent pressure.  \\n**Evidence (summary):** Local evidence suggests modest rental stock returns.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Assumptions & Justification\\n\\n| Assumption | Value Used | Source | Confidence | Sensitivity |\\n|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------|\\n| Supply elasticity | Tunable range | Literature‑informed proxy | Medium | High |\\n| Demand elasticity | Tunable range | Literature‑informed proxy | Medium | High |\\n| Construction capacity | City baseline + policy boost | Planning benchmarks | Medium | High |\\n| Population growth | City baseline + shocks | ABS / historical trend | Medium | Medium |\\n| Wage growth | City baseline projection | Historical trend | Medium | Medium |\\n| Investor share | Baseline estimate | Historical proxy | Low‑Medium | High |\\n| Rent regulation effect | Capped growth | Policy design | Low | Medium |\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n- Values are designed to be transparent and adjustable.\\n- Confidence reflects data availability, not certainty of outcomes.\\n- Sensitivity indicates how strongly outputs change if assumption shifts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Validation & Accuracy\\n\\n**Historical backtesting.** The model aligns the historical series (where available) with observed data from ~2000 to the baseline year and compares projected paths to known trends.\\n\\n**Residual error.** When backtesting, the model tracks the gap between predicted and observed values; large residuals signal the need for parameter adjustment.\\n\\n**Sensitivity analysis.** Key sensitivities include:\\n- Supply elasticity\\n- Investor demand elasticity\\n- Construction capacity\\n- Migration assumptions\\n\\n**Scenario testing.**\\n- Best‑case: High supply response + moderate demand.\\n- Worst‑case: Low supply response + high demand.\\n- Median: Balanced adjustments with conservative effects.\\n\\n**Uncertainty.**\\n- Results are not deterministic predictions.\\n- Confidence bands are conceptual, not probabilistic.\\n- Exact outcomes depend on real‑world implementation and timing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Usage Guide\\n\\n**Step‑by‑step workflow.**\\n1. Choose a scope (National / State / City / SA2/3/4 if enabled).\\n2. Select a scenario preset (or combine presets).\\n3. Adjust policy levers (intensity, ramp‑up, and timing).\\n4. Review charts and heatmap for trade‑offs.\\n5. Compare against baseline to interpret impact.\\n\\n**Sample input.**\\n- Negative gearing removal: 0.6\\n- Ownership cap enforcement: 0.4\\n- Supply boost: 0.3\\n- Ramp‑up years: 5\\n\\n**Expected outputs (narrative example).**\\nYou should see lower investor demand, modest price growth reduction, and gradual supply uplift. The affordability index should improve relative to baseline but remain sensitive to population growth.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9.
